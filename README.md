# medpow8
medpow8 - This is a processor architecture that has a powerful set of commands and a relatively average complexity in implementation. This architecture allows programming various devices that do not have firmware - this is the main goal of this architecture. It uses low power and memory (by modern standards) but allows you to squeeze out maximum performance and minimal memory consumption due to the lack of firmware. This also has its downsides, for example, that you will have to write most things manually. However, the main mission of this architecture is rather an easy and fast implementation of processors on this architecture in various computer games, rather than a real competitive, modern solution. This architecture will gradually develop into new versions that will only complement its main goal.
